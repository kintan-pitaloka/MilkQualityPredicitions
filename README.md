# Milk Quality Prediction Dataset

## Overview

This dataset has been manually collected from observations to help build machine-learning models for predicting the quality of milk. The dataset includes 7 independent variables that contribute to determining the grade or quality of milk.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following features:

- **pH**: The pH level of the milk.
- **Temperature**: The temperature at which the milk is stored.
- **Taste**: Binary value (1 if the taste is optimal, 0 otherwise).
- **Odor**: Binary value (1 if the odor is optimal, 0 otherwise).
- **Fat**: Binary value (1 if the fat content is optimal, 0 otherwise).
- **Turbidity**: Binary value (1 if the turbidity is optimal, 0 otherwise).
- **Color**: The color value of the milk (measured as an integer).

The target variable is the **Grade** of the milk, which is categorized as follows:

- **Low (Bad)**
- **Medium (Moderate)**
- **High (Good)**

## Usage

This dataset can be used to perform data preprocessing, apply data augmentation techniques, and build statistical and predictive models to predict the quality of milk.

### Inspiration

The purpose of this dataset is to leverage the benefits of machine learning in the dairy industry by accurately predicting the quality of milk based on various parameters.
